The [NSDF Dark Matter Dashboard](https://intersect.nationalsciencedatafabric.org/darkmatter/nexus-dashboard) provides a way to visualize the **SuperCDMS DAQ data** format and follows the event structure defined by [Midas](https://daq00.triumf.ca/MidasWiki/index.php/Event_Structure). The dashboard is made up of multiple components and is divided into two main sections: the sidebar controls and the channels plot.

## ☰ Sidebar controls

The controls located in the left sidebar manipulate the display of the channels plot section. The following components are part of the sidebar controls: the mid file selector, event text input, event controls, detector section, channel button grid, and event metadata table.

### Mid File Selector

The mid file selector allows the user to select a specific mid file record from the storage. After selecting a mid file, the event text input becomes available.

### Event text input

The event text input facilitates navigation through the different events as specified by the **SuperCDMS DAQ data format**. The user can search an specific event by typing the eventID number.

### Event controls

The event controls provide an alternative way to navigate through events in order. It consists of four buttons: first event, previous event, next event, and last event. When used in combination with the event text input, these buttons also allow navigation with respect to the eventID selected.

### Detector section

The detector multichoice allows the user to select the detectors of interest for a specific event. By selecting or deselecting a detector, the channels plot on the right updates accordingly (with all detectors selected by default). A checkbox is provided to enable or disable all detectors at once.

### Channel button grid

The channel button grid corresponds to the 20 possible channels that a detector might have (all selected by default). When clicked, it will toggle the inclusion of channels from the selected detectors, either displaying or hiding them on the channels plot.

### Event metadata table

The event metadata table dynamically displays the trigger type, readout type, and global timestamp associated with an eventID.

## 📈 Channels plot section

The section of the right displays the channels in a plot, and updates dynamically depending on the controls selected. A typical workflow might look like this:

![dashboard_workflow_1](./assets/dashboard/UI_SLAC_1.png)

The user starts with 2 detectors (D1, D2), and has 3 channels selected (C1,C2,C3). Therefore, the channels plot shows (D1C1, D1C2, D1C3, D2C1, D2C2, D2C3).

![dashboard_workflow_2](./assets/dashboard/UI_SLAC_2.png)

After, the user deselects C3 on the channel button grid, it removes the associated channel C3 from the detectors, resulting in plot (D1C1,D1C2, D2C1,D2C2).

![dashboard_workflow_3](./assets/dashboard/UI_SLAC_3.png)

Lastly, the user removes D2 from the multichoice detector, resulting in the plot (D1C1,D1C2). The channels of a detector are represented by a gradient of a color.
