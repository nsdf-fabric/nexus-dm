## Overview

**Nexus-DM** delivers state-of-the-art tools for accessing and analyzing dark matter data, including a web-based event visualization [dashboard](https://nsdf-fabric.github.io/nexus-dm/dashboard/), a [command-line interface](https://nsdf-fabric.github.io/nexus-dm/cli/) (CLI) for data access,
and a [library](https://nsdf-fabric.github.io/nexus-dm/library/) for data manipulation. By combining ease of access with scientific depth, the initiative empowers the community to accelerate discovery in dark matter research.

## ⚡Quick Start

To get up and running quickly, follow the step-by-step guides found in the [Nexus-DM documentation](https://nsdf-fabric.github.io/nexus-dm/)

## 🚀 Features

- **Web-based visualization:** Explore midas files, isolate detector channels, and examine detailed metadata such as trigger types and timestamps, all within the browser with the [NSDF Dark Matter Dashboard](https://nsdf-fabric.github.io/nexus-dm/dashboard/).
- **Easy data access via CLI**: Effortlessly search, and download dark matter data files using the [NSDF Dark Matter CLI](https://nsdf-fabric.github.io/nexus-dm/cli/).
- **Workflow integration**: Leverage [NSDF Dark Matter Library](https://nsdf-fabric.github.io/nexus-dm/library/) to load and manipulate dark matter data, enabling seamless integration into workflow pipelines, including machine learning.
- **Search events**: Search for specific events using the autocomplete input.
- **Visualization**: Visualize channel waveforms from multiple detectors.
- **Channel isolation**: Select or deselect channels from one or more detectors.
- **Event metadata**: View information about the trigger type, readout type, and timestamp of the events.

## ⚙️Workflow Suite

### 📊 NSDF Dark Matter Dashboard

The [NSDF Dark Matter Dashboard](https://intersect.nationalsciencedatafabric.org/darkmatter/nexus-dashboard) provides a web-based interface to visualize and explore dark matter data all within the browser. Learn about the controls that make the dashboard from [dashboard guide](https://nsdf-fabric.github.io/nexus-dm/dashboard/).

### 🖥️ NSDF Dark Matter CLI

The [NSDF Dark Matter CLI](https://nsdf-fabric.github.io/nexus-dm/cli/) offers a pool of operations to access the R76 dark matter dataset. The CLI can be used as part of a workflow to download data which can
then be analyzed with the [NSDF Dark Matter Library](https://nsdf-fabric.github.io/nexus-dm/library/). Learn about the CLI from [CLI guide](https://nsdf-fabric.github.io/nexus-dm/cli/).

### 📚 NSDF Dark Matter Library

The [NSDF Dark Matter Library](https://nsdf-fabric.github.io/nexus-dm/library/) offers a pool of operations to manipulate dark matter data from getting event metadata to detector channel data acquisition. Learn about the library usage in [library guide](https://nsdf-fabric.github.io/nexus-dm/library/).
